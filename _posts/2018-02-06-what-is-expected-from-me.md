Recently I attended an interview, irrespective of whether I got selected or not I thought I will just notedown the expectations they had on me as a 8 years experienced software developer.

Having good handson experience, to the level of converting the basic algo approach into code. Finding edge cases and handling it in the code, knowing where the code might fail.

Datastructures & Algo. Though it had been long time since I learnt those in college days, this was also another expectation. To be frank, now to read the algo s again its quite interesting.

Think well through the architecture. Should able to explain the whole project with the architecture components, what are the design choices made and why. Also to know about popular open source project and how the architecture was designed, eg: how job scheduling can be done in a better way. As we go deep into the question it drilled down to how hadoop works ? Or having knowledge about how hadoop works would be good.

Though they haven t asked about it, I felt having good online presence is a must for 8 year experienced person. Sources from which I can go and learn and contribution I make.

Had a good time knowing what are the things to keep in mind. This is to make sure that I ll not lose the bigger picture when working day in and out.
