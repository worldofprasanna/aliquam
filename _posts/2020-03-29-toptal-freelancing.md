I am a solid coder for long time, but never gave a tech talk or wrote a blog about tech topics. After joining [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), I realised the value of having an opinion, being vocal about the technology and mentoring my colleagues in the right direction.

After my (nearly 4 years) tenure at Thoughtworks, I joined my friend's startup [Francium Technologies](https://francium.tech/) with the motive to apply these basic principles of a consultant at the right situation. 

I was more interested in creating a culture of having healthy conversation about technology and realised that there is no platform in the company to share the technical learnings. I started "Thursday Devops" sessions, where I will prepare a topic in the technology used and gave a talk about it. After 5 - 6 sessions, people started volunteering and it became a part of the culture. I maintained 22 week streak and at the same time I started blogging about the topics which I presented.

Few talks & its blog posts (and there are many such):

[CI & CD for Apps in Kubernetes](https://blog.francium.tech/a983e29575ac)
[The Lifecycle of a Kubernetes Pod](https://blog.francium.tech/1214199ddd2c)
[Automated Pipelines using CircleCI](https://blog.francium.tech/93a972723265)

Recently, I was more interested in Free lancing as I could make time to talk about technology, contribute to open source projects and travel around the world. Till now, I was very much hesitant to do so, not because I will not get any projects / clients, but because of the quality of work which I would get, missing my office community and most importantly I felt there are quite a lot of people bargaining for the same work with cheaper prices. So I didn t give it a try, untill I came to know about [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/). That changed my mind completely about free lancing. 

I got introduced to Toptal through their blog post about [Concurrency & Parallelism in Ruby](https://www.toptal.com/ruby/ruby-concurrency-and-parallelism-a-practical-primer), which gave me the right information I need. Then I looked at other blog posts and started researching about Toptal and I felt this is the platform, I want to be part of. I was more attracted towards their interview process, Tech community (meetups they conduct) and confidence which the clients have in Toptal.

I immediately applied for Devops position in Toptal and in the middle of screening process. Hopefully will get a chance to be part of an awesome Toptal community.
