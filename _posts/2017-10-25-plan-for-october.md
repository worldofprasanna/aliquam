It was utter flop :-( - January 2018

I thought of focusing on Devops this year and tried to learn few tools and practices around it. As it was a very broad area and priorities got changed, the goal got diluted and for the past few months haven t focused on anything in particular. So thought of looking at the courses I want to attend, books I had planned to read and make a plan for short period. For a month.

So November month,

## Courses:

-	AWS Certified sysops admin
-	Terraform

I started both the courses, couldn t complete for many reasons. So will focus on these 2 this month.

## Books:

-	The Phoenix project
-	Getting started with Terraform (This is the book written by my colleague)

Another way to get focussed is to do things around that area so,

-	thought of writing blog about the courses I attend and books I read
-	Knowing more about the tools
-	Reading & contributing to the open source projects

By end of november will update with what happened actually. Will these things work or not.
